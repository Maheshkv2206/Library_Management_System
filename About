Technologies Used in the Project:-
1.Programming Language:
  * Java: Utilizes core Java concepts and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for database interaction.
2.Database:
  * MySQL: For efficient and reliable database management, storing information about books, users, and issued/returned books.
3.Development Tools (IDE):
  * Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for coding, debugging, and managing the development workflow.

How to Run the Application:-
1.Clone the Repository:
  *  Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2.Import the Project into Your IDE:
  * Open your favorite IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
  * Import the project as a Maven/Gradle/Java project (depending on the setup).
  * Ensure all dependencies are correctly loaded.
3.Configure the MySQL Database:
  * Open the DBConnection class in the project.
  *  Update the database configuration parameters:
      String url = "jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database_name>";
      String username = "<your_username>";
      String password = "<your_password>";
  * Ensure the database schema is created and matches the project requirements. You may find SQL scripts in the repository to set up tables.
4.Run the Application:
  * Locate the main class (LibrarySystem or equivalent).
  * Right-click the class in your IDE and select Run As > Java Application.
  * The application will start, allowing you to manage books, users, and issued/returned books.

Database Design:-
1. Books Table
  * Stores details about the books available in the library.
2. Users Table
